# Reflection

Over the past two milestones, you've had the opportunity to apply several software engineering practices and processes in the design and implementation of a bot project.

### Design

1. What was most helpful about thinking about design methods of your project?

It was extremely helpful using design methods for this project since it was the preliminary design work that set the foundation for the rest of the project and helped us avoid unforeseen issues that could have forced an unwanted pivot during our programming timeline. Cognitive walkthroughs, a variant of dot voting, storyboarding, wireframing, and usability testing were design methods that my group used, and that ability to put each of us on the same page made working through the project much less confusing than it could've been.

2. What was most difficult? What would you do differently?

The most difficult part of design was actually the initial wireframing. I understand that a wireframe might be more helpful for projects with a higher focus on front-end and UI, but since our project was a Discord bot, wireframing didn't provide much more insight than a good brainstorming session did. Maybe next time, it would make more sense to approach the wireframe from a different perspective than what we submitted for the wireframing assignment, since our submission of screenshots of the Discord bot sending chat messages wasn't too helpful for anyone.

3. What design methods might you want to try again in the future on another project?

I'll definitely be applying a lot of the many design methods learned in this class, but the one that stood out the most to me is dot voting. Although other design methods have the advantage in certain scenarios, I found dot voting to be versatile enough to apply to any project and intuitive enough where group members new to the concept could pick it up quickly. That's me speaking from experiencing, because before this project, I had no clue how to use dot voting but after a quick explanation, all my groupmates and I were ready to enact it. It set the frame for what issues to focus on as we did our work, and helped us mentally prepare for the more difficult/significant tasks.

### Testing

1. What was most helpful about implementing, testing, and integration in your bot project?

The most helpful thing about implementing, testing, and integration of our bot project was discovered when we split up the work for the project and unit tested before merging our respective parts into the main branch. Applying the principles we learned in the testing slides for this class allowed us to fix bugs before adding too many functionalities to the main branch, which would have made it much more difficult to not only fix issues, but also to keep the runway clear for future ideas. Unit testing allowed us to keep our project running smoothly even when all four of us were working on different functionalities on different branches all at the same time.

2. What was most difficult? What would you do differently?

The most difficult part about implementation was working on functionalities that either required an input from a functionality that someone else was working on or on functionalities that outputted an essential part to someone else's part. For example, I worked on the automatic text parsing for the bot, which meant that I had to implement code that would detect when certain phrases were sent as part of a message. I initially had a hard time figuring out what my functions should output (what to send to our database), since I was knowledgeable about what I needed to get my part to work, but not about what my other groupmate would need from me for his part. Next time, I would ask more clarifying questions during our meetings, instead of only asking when the issue would arise.

3. What implementation, testing, and integration methods might you want to try again in the future on another project?

Unit testing was a method that was especially powerful. I've done some research on what software engineering is like in industry, and found that unit testing is a universal and fundamental experience in any size project. Although the other methods mentioned in lecture are sure to be helpful, it seems like unit testing is one of the most important things to get right as a software engineer before sending your code in for a code review.


### Process

1. What was most helpful about implementing kanban and code review in your project?

Scrumban was immensely helpful in both doing the project and in teaching me more about software processes. Having GitHub's project board to refer to at times of uncertainty and during our meetings ensured that everyone stayed on track and knew not only what they were doing but how to do it as well. Also, it was very gratifying to be able to move issues from "work in progress" to "done," and closing the issue. Code review was also important because it ensured functionality for the overall bot, but gave each groupmember a chance to teach to and learn from other groupmembers.

2. What was most difficult? What would you do differently?

I didn't find anything particularly difficult about implementing scrumban and code review. If the project were more difficult or covered a wider scope, it might have been difficult to reconcile between each groupmember's varying levels of knowledge, but the project was low-stakes enough where it wasn't difficult to maintain team cohesion. Next time, we might make it more clear which sprint is which and what goals are to be achieved for each sprint for higher clarity, but even then I think we did a decent job this time around.

3. What software processes or practices might you want to try again in the future on another project?

From what I know about the industry, scrumban and other Agile methodologies are the standard for the overwhelming majority of companies. I would like to try to enact these practices again for a future project except as the scrum master, since that role was rightly given to another groupmate this time around. I think that trying out that new role would grant me more insight to the new processses learned this semester.

### Overall

Considering all the design methods, implementation practices, and software processes you've encountered---**compare and contrast** how the benefits of the different practices and how they might be useful together.

Overall, I've learned that even more important than knowing about the details of each diffierent design method, implementation practice, and software practice is knowing **when** to use each. Stakeholder and user interviews, affinity diagramming, and card sorting wouldn't make sense for a personal, one-man hobby project, but those are the exact methods one should look to implement if working on a multi-team project with multiple stakeholders. The same conceptr applies to implementation practices and software processes. A lot of the concepts work great in certain scenarios but could leave a large gap in other cases. In this case, it's important to implement other concepts to reinforce a particular workflow and to strengthen the overall product. Unit testing is fantastic for making sure your specific module works, for example, but without integration testing, there's no way to ensure that it'll work with the rest of the project at hand.
